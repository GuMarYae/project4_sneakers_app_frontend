## Challenges
pushing up the backend had a lowercase procfile, which means it wont run. It,ll crash. All Procfiles need to have an uppercase P. Pic is attached in the challenges folder

had to enable debugging so the network can show exactly where the second error was on the backend. spent 7 hours on the frontend prior to this until I realized that the 500 error was routing to a capital "y" in  the backend folder.

Had trouble putting the new contents on the index contents so I can have the modal on the index. So, instead, put the modal on the new route.
